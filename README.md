- A custom OS for the ComputerCraft mod for Minecraft.

## Installation
- You dont.

## Setup Instruction
- Read ios/security/.KEYINFO
- Change your keys in ios/security/.keys
- The encryption key, and rednet key must be 16 characters long (No more, no less)
- I'd recommend changing all of the keys...
